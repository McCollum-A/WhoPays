WhoPays?
by Andrew McCollum, 2020

This program will be an app for mobile, Android and Iphone, to do the math of splitting a bill for the party.
Supoprt includes even splits (cost / number of people paying) and custom splits where you customize
what percentage each person pays.

Currenty it is in the form of a prototype python script, with my current work adding an interface.

Once a prototype with interface functions well, the work will commence for UI and platform support.
