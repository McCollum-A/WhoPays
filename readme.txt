WhoPays?
by Andrew McCollum, 2021

This program will be an app for mobile, Android and Iphone, to do the math of splitting a bill for the party.
Supoprt includes even splits (cost / number of people paying) and cumputing a percentage of the tip for when
someone is paying you back.

Currently there is a prototype python script, testing an interface using TKinter, and a few python files to
work out how I want to implement various maths.

Once the TKinter prototype is functioning, I will start work on mock-ups, and porting it for android.
